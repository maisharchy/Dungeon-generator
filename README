My program generates a simple dungeon layout using C. It places rooms 
randomly within a grid, connects them with corridors, and adds 
staircases for navigation.

Features Implemented:

Dungeon Grid: 80x21 grid representing the dungeon.

Room Placement: At least 6 randomly sized rooms are placed in valid locations.

Corridors: Rooms are connected using corridors ('#').

Stair Placement: One upward ('<') and one downward ('>') staircase are 
placed in random rooms.

Dungeon Display: The final dungeon layout is printed to the console.

Functions Implemented:

init_dungeon() - Initializes the dungeon grid, setting all positions to
 empty space.

is_valid_room(int x, int y, int w, int h) - Checks if a room of given 
dimensions can be placed without overlap.

place_rooms() - Randomly generates and places rooms in the dungeon.

connect_rooms() - Connects placed rooms using corridors.

place_stairs() - Places stairs ('<' and '>') randomly within rooms.

print_dungeon() - Displays the final dungeon layout in the console.

main() - Controls the sequence of dungeon generation and execution.


Compile the program:

gcc dun.c -Wall -Werror -o dun

or use make command 

Run the executable:

./dun
