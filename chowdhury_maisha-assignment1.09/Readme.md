### `assignment 1.09`
I have used the instructors code. For some reason when I first ran the code without adding anything everytime I use the make command and run the program it freezes. I have been unable to fix this issue even after I wrote the changes for this assignment. Als another bug that I have encountered from the instructors code is every 30-33 key press or so the game freezes. I have to terminate the current process to start the program again. THis issue was from before, from the instructors code only. I don't know where the bug is, I tried but couldn't figure out.
